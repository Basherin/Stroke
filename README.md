# Stroke Screening Tool

A compact, git-ready repository providing a combined stroke screening tool for
both acute recognition (BE-FAST) and preventive risk-factor assessment.

This repo includes:
- **ALGORITHM.md** — detailed screening flowchart and guidance (Mermaid diagram).
- **index.html** — a single-file poster/webview for quick reference.
- **stroke_flowchart.svg** — printable SVG poster you can use in clinics (also embedded in index.html).
- **LICENSE** — MIT.

## Quick use
- Open `index.html` in a browser for an at-a-glance poster.
- View `ALGORITHM.md` on GitHub to render the Mermaid flowchart.
- Adapt `ALGORITHM.md` or `index.html` for your clinical workflow or poster prints.

## Warning
This tool is for **screening and triage** guidance only. It does **not** replace clinical judgement, local protocols, or definitive diagnostics (CT/MRI, specialist assessment).
